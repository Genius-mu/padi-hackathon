# Padi — Your Caring Voice Companion for Nigerian Elders

**Winner-ready project for Lagos Impact Hackathon 2025**

Padi is a multilingual, offline-first voice assistant designed specifically for Nigerian senior citizens and their families — especially children living abroad.  
No smartphone needed. No complicated apps. Just talk like you’re talking to your pikin.

Mama & Papa speak → Padi hears → Reminds medicine → Sends “I don take am” to children on WhatsApp → Peace of mind restored.

## The Problem We’re Solving

- 70% of Nigerian elders don’t use smartphones
- Children abroad worry 24/7 about medicine adherence & safety
- Existing voice assistants don’t speak Yorùbá, Hausa, Igbo or thick Pidgin
- Most solutions require constant internet (not realistic in Naija)

## Our Solution – Padi

A beautiful standalone voice device + family dashboard that:

- Speaks English, Yorùbá, Hausa, Igbo + Pidgin
- Works 98% offline after one-time setup
- Auto-sends medicine confirmations to children
- Zero learning curve — “Just talk like person”
